The box shows typical corrugated cardboard texture and has a white pharmaceutical label with item numbers, batch information, and storage instructions. Corner/Edge Exclusion: No other cardboard boxes are visible in corners or edges of the image. Single Subject Confirmation: This one cardboard shipping container is clearly the sole subject of the image, significantly larger than any other potential boxes, and centrally positioned. The label indicates it contains '90 BOX @ 50 PC' which refers to the pharmaceutical products inside this single cardboard shipping container, not separate cardboard boxes. Internal dot assignment: • (one dot for the single dominant cardboard shipping box).

On that box I read three stacked labels: 'MAN 2024-06', 'EXP 2027-05', and 'LOT PDFD'. The Batch Number was found after the 'LOT' label as 'PDFD'. The Expiration Date string found was 'EXP 2027-05' (YYYY-MM format). I interpreted '2027-05' as Year=2027, Month=05 and, because no day is present, set Day=01 per instructions, yielding formatted EXP = 05/01/2027. A Manufacturing string 'MAN 2024-06' was also present and interpreted as MFD = 06/01/2024, which is <= the current date and earlier than the EXP; EXP (05/01/2027) is later than MFD and is in the future relative to the current date (assumed 2025-09-16). Other background text (if any) such as codes or labels not requested were ignored. Confidence: batch 'PDFD' is clear and labeled (90/100); EXP interpretation is clear and yields a future date consistent with MFD (95/100).\"}]}\n",
